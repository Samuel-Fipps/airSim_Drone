Teaching a reinforcement learning (RL) model to follow a bus using a drone in Unreal Engine can be a complex task. Breaking the process down into simpler sub-tasks can be a good approach to make the training more tractable. Here's a potential step-by-step approach:

1. Basic Drone Control:
Start by teaching the drone to take off, hover at a specific altitude, and land. This will ensure the RL agent understands the basic controls of the drone.
Introduce movement controls one axis at a time. For instance, first allow the drone to move forward and backward. Then, introduce left and right, followed by up and down.
As the RL agent learns these basic controls, you can gradually introduce combinations of movements. This will help the agent understand the drone's dynamics in a controlled manner.

2. Obstacle Avoidance:
Once the RL model can reliably control the drone, introduce static obstacles. This will teach the drone to avoid collisions.
Gradually increase the complexity of the environment by adding moving obstacles or changing lighting conditions. This will prepare the drone for a dynamic environment where a bus and other entities are moving.
Bus Tracking:

3. Start by having a stationary bus. The task for the drone would be to position itself at a certain distance and angle from the bus. This will help the agent learn how to approach and maintain a certain distance from the target.
Introduce a moving bus, but at a constant speed and in a straight line. The drone's task would be to follow the bus.
Introduce more complex bus movements such as turns, stops, and variable speeds. This will teach the drone to adapt to the bus's unpredictable movements.

4. Combining Skills:
Once the drone can reliably follow the bus and avoid obstacles independently, combine the two tasks. The drone should be able to follow the bus in a dynamic environment with other vehicles, pedestrians, and various obstacles.

5. Generalization:
To make your RL agent robust, it's essential to expose it to a variety of scenarios. Different buses, environments, weather conditions in Unreal Engine, etc., will help in achieving this.

6. Optimization:
Once your model is proficient in following a bus, you can optimize its behavior. This can include minimizing the drone's movement to conserve battery, ensuring the drone's camera always has the bus in view for potential surveillance applications, etc.

7. A few other points to consider:
Sim-to-real Transfer: If you plan to transfer the learned policy to a real drone, you will need to consider the differences between the simulation and real world. Domain adaptation or domain randomization are common techniques to bridge this gap.
Reward Shaping: Designing a suitable reward function for RL can be challenging. Ensure your reward function effectively guides the agent towards desired behaviors without introducing unintended behaviors.
Utilizing a framework that integrates with Unreal Engine, like Microsoft's AirSim, can be helpful in setting up these RL tasks.
